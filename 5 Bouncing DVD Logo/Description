DVD players. When not playing DVDs, they
would display a diagonally traveling DVD logo
that bounced off the edges of the screen. This program simulates this colorful DVD logo by making it
change direction each time it hits an edge. We’ll also
keep track of how many times a logo hits a corner of
the screen. This creates an interesting visual animation to look at, especially for the magical moment
when a logo lines up perfectly with a corner


Working
You may remember Cartesian coordinates from your math class in
school. In programming, the x-coordinate represents an object’s horizontal position and the y-coordinate represents its vertical position, just like
in mathematics. However, unlike in mathematics, the origin point (0, 0)
is in the upper-left corner of the screen, and the y-coordinate increases
as you go down. The x-coordinate increases as the object moves right,
just like in mathematics.
